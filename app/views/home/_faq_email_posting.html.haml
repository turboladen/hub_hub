  %h2 Can I post to MindHub via sending an email?

  %p
    Yes!  ...but you have to follow some rules:
    %ol
      %li You must be MindHub member.
      %li
        You must send the email from the address that's tied to your MindHub
        account.
      %li No attachments.  If you send one, it will be discarded.
      %li
        You must follow
        %a{ href: '#email_subject_guidelines' } the subject line guidelines
        below.

    If you send an email, then don't see it on the site, it may be because you
    didn't follow the rules.

  %p
    %a{ name: 'email_subject_guidelines' }
    %strong Email Subject Line Guidelines

  %p
    In order to tell MindHub which spoke you want to post your post in, you need
    to format the subject of your email like this:

    %tt [Spoke name]: [Post title]

    \.  For example:

    %tt Events: Farmer's Market
    %br

  %p
    If MindHub doesn't recognize the spoke from your subject line (i.e. if you
    don't include one), your post will be posted in the
    %code Chat
    spoke.

  %p
    As an extra precaution, you should add
    %tt poster@chat.mindhub.org
    to your "allow" list in your e-mail Spam filter.  If you make a mistake
    posting (well, one that disallows you from actually submitting the post),
    MindHub will email you from this address to let you know what went wrong.
