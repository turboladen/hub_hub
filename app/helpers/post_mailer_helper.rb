Hi #{@to_address},

It looks like you're trying to post an email to #{home_url}, but you don't have
an account there (not with this email address, at least).  If you'd like to take

Hi #{@user.first_name},

It looks like you tried emailing a post to a MindHub spoke called
'#{@spoke_name}'--MindHub doesn't have a spoke for that right now, but perhaps
you meant to post to a different spoke?  The spokes MindHub has available right
now are:

You might also check to make sure you're using the correct format in your Subject
line:

  [spoke name]: [post title]

Hope that helps...
